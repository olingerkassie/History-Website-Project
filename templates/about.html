        <h1>Meet the Team</h1>
        <p>
            We’re two students passionate about technology and its potential to drive meaningful change. But too often, tech education feels gatekept—buried under complicated language, dense writing, or exclusive spaces.
            That’s why we created this website: to make tech history more accessible, inclusive, and easy to understand. Our goal is to offer clear, engaging information that anyone can connect with—whether you're a beginner, a lifelong learner, or just tech-curious.
            Because we believe that understanding the past is key to building a better, more equitable future in tech.

                <p>As a computer science student, I was excited to dive into tech—but also intimidated by its complexity and how male-dominated the field is. That feeling of not belonging stayed with me, which is why this project is so important. My goal is to make tech education more accessible and empower underrepresented groups to follow their passions in this space.</p>
