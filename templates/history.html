    <h1>Where Do We Start?</h1>
    <p>
      The history of computer science is a journey from ancient counting tools to todayâ€™s digital age. It began with early mechanical calculators and mathematical theories, advanced through theoretical breakthroughs by pioneers like Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, and accelerated with the invention of electronic computers. The mid-20th century saw the rise of personal computers and the internet, forever transforming the way society communicates, works, and innovates.
