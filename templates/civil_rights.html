    <h2>Impact of The Civil Rights Movement</h2>
    <p>    The Civil Rights Movement didn‚Äôt just change laws‚Äîit reshaped opportunities across every industry, including tech. As activists fought for racial justice, new doors began to open in education, employment, and innovation. This section explores how the push for civil rights helped diversify the tech world and laid the groundwork for greater equity in the digital age.</p>

    <h1>Tech Meets the Movement</h1>
    <p>
        Before Google searches and smartphone swipes, there was marching, organizing, and demanding justice. The Civil Rights Movement wasn‚Äôt just about changing laws‚Äîit was about changing futures. As activists fought for racial equality, their work cracked open doors that had long been slammed shut in fields like education, science, and yes‚Äîtechnology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this movement, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) saw a rise in STEM programs. Federal policies like affirmative action pushed universities and tech companies to rethink who deserved a seat at the table. And pioneers like Clarence ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù Ellis‚Äîwho became the first Black person to earn a PhD in computer science‚Äîgot their shot to shape the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ripple effects of the Civil Rights era still impact the tech industry today. It laid the foundation for broader access, inspired generations of innovators, and started the long (but powerful) push for true diversity in STEM.

        From ancient tools like the abacus to the powerful AI of today, the tech industry has evolved through centuries of breakthroughs. Early innovations in logic and machinery laid the groundwork, while visionaries like Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing pushed the boundaries of what machines could do. The rise of personal computers in the 1970s and the explosion of the internet in the 1990s brought computing into everyday life, leading to today‚Äôs era of cloud platforms, automation, and global connectivity. The story of tech is one of imagination, reinvention, and the endless pursuit of what‚Äôs next.
