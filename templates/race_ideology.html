    <h2>Racial Ideologies in Tech</h2>
    <p>Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it reflects the society that creates it. This page explores how racial ideologies have shaped the development, distribution, and impact of computing from its origins to today.</p>

    <h1>It’s Not Just Code</h1>
    <p>
      Racial thinking, the belief that a person's abilities, intelligence, or worth are determined by their race, has profoundly influenced the development and culture of the tech industry. From who gets hired to who builds the tools we use, racial ideologies have influenced access, opportunity, and representation.

      <h2>Exclusion From the Beginning</h2>
      <p>From the start, tech was seen as a space for white, affluent men. Black and Brown people were often excluded from science and tech education, especially in the early days of computing. Access to resources, training, and job opportunities was limited and still is in many places.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Underfunded schools in Black and Brown communities lacked access to science and computer labs.</li>
        <li>Scholarships and internships in tech were primarily offered to white students until recent decades.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s 2014 Diversity in High Tech Report, only 7.4% of employees in the high-tech sector were Black, even though Black individuals made up around 13% of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanic workers represented about 8% of the tech workforce, despite accounting for 18% of the population by 2019. When looking at gender and race together, the disparity grows Black, Latina, and Native American women collectively earned just 4% of computing degrees in 2016. A Wired article (paywalled) noted that in some companies, these representation gaps have seen little to no improvement over the following five years.</p>

      <p>"Only 2% of Black Tech workers hold leadership positions"</p>

      <h2>The Myth of Meritocracy</h2>
      <p>Many companies say they hire based on “merit,” but that idea often hides real racial bias. Hiring managers may unconsciously judge candidates based on how they speak, dress, or where they went to school — things that are shaped by race and class.</p>
      <p>The term <strong>“culture fit”</strong> is often used to exclude candidates who don’t match the company’s dominant (usually white and male) culture. Instead of focusing on skills and potential, companies sometimes use "culture fit" as an excuse to hire people who look, act, and think like the people already there. This keeps workplaces from becoming truly diverse and continues cycles of inequality, even when the company says it supports diversity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standardized hiring tests can favor candidates from certain educational backgrounds.</li>
        <li>Interviews often reward cultural familiarity over raw skill or creativity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bias in Tech Tools and Algorithms</h2>
      <p>Technology is often thought of as neutral, but it isn’t. Bias can be built into software, especially when it’s trained on data that reflects racial inequality.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Facial recognition systems:</strong> Misidentify Black and Brown faces more often.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiring software:</strong> Filters out names that “sound Black.”</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive policing tools:</strong> Target communities of color.</li>
        <li><strong>Language models:</strong> May reflect harmful stereotypes based on training data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Digital Redlining</h2>
      <p>Digital redlining is when tech systems reinforce inequality by limiting access to online resources and opportunities. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some communities don’t have access to high-speed internet.</li>
        <li>Job ads are shown more to white users than Black ones.</li>
        <li>Tech education programs are less available in low-income or minority areas.</li>
        <li>Targeted advertising reinforces segregation in housing and finance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Erasure of Innovators</h2>
      <p>Many Black and Brown pioneers in tech have been left out of history books.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mark Dean:</strong>  A computer scientist and engineer who helped develop the IBM personal computer (PC) in the 1980s. Dean holds three of the nine original patents for the IBM PC and later led the design team for the first 1-Gigahertz computer processor.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarence “Skip” Ellis:</strong> The first Black person to earn a Ph.D. in computer science (University of Illinois, 1969). He contributed to the development of operational transformation, a foundation for collaborative editing software like Google Docs, and worked on groundbreaking projects at Xerox PARC.</li>
        <li><strong>Katherine Johnson:</strong> One of the first African American women to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics. She worked on computer programming for NASA’s Apollo space missions.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="image-row">

      <h2>Retaliation Against Whistleblowers</h2>
      <p>When people of color speak out against racism in tech, they’re often ignored — or worse, pushed out. One well-known case is Dr. Timnit Gebru, a leading AI researcher who was forced out of Google after raising concerns about racial bias in algorithms and questioning the ethical implications of large language models. Her departure sparked international outrage and brought attention to how tech companies handle dissent, particularly from marginalized employees.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethics researchers are often underfunded or dismissed in major tech companies.</li>
        <li>Racial justice advocates in tech may face public or professional backlash.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reclaiming Tech Through Activism</h2>
      <p>Despite the challenges, Black and Brown communities are reclaiming tech in powerful ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Black Girls Code:</strong> Founded by Kimberly Bryant, this organization empowers young Black girls by teaching them coding, robotics, and computer science skills, aiming to close the tech diversity gap from the ground up.</li>
        <li><strong>Data for Black Lives:</strong>  A movement that harnesses the power of data science to fight systemic racism and promote justice. They advocate for ethical data practices that center and uplift marginalized communities.</li>
        <li><strong>Afrotech:</strong> One of the largest multicultural tech conferences, Afrotech brings together Black tech innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors to build a future where technology is inclusive, equitable, and empowering for all.</li>
      </ul>

  <p>
    The tech industry has long mirrored the inequalities of the world around it—but that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. By learning about the past, confronting uncomfortable truths, and amplifying the voices of those historically pushed to the margins, we open the door to a more equitable future. Tech is powerful, but the people shaping it are even more so. Let’s keep building systems—and communities—that reflect justice, access, and representation for everyone.
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
    The history of race in tech is one of barriers broken and voices rising. As the industry evolves, so does the fight for equity—and the next chapter is being written by all of us.
