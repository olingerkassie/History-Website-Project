    <h2>Racial Ideologies in Tech</h2>
    <p>Technology doesn‚Äôt exist in a vacuum‚Äîit reflects the society that creates it. This page explores how racial ideologies have shaped the development, distribution, and impact of computing from its origins to today.</p>

    <h1>It‚Äôs Not Just Code</h1>
    <p>
      Racial bias has been embedded in the tech industry since its early days‚Äîfrom who had access to education, to the systems being designed today. Let‚Äôs unpack the myths, highlight the innovators, and spotlight activism that‚Äôs reclaiming the space.

      <h2>Exclusion From the Beginning</h2>
      <p>From the start, tech was seen as a space for white, affluent men. Black and Brown people were often excluded from science and tech education, especially in the early days of computing. Access to resources, training, and job opportunities was limited and still is in many places.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Underfunded schools in Black and Brown communities lacked access to science and computer labs.</li>
        <li>Scholarships and internships in tech were primarily offered to white students until recent decades.</li>
      </ul>

        </div>
      <h2>The Myth of Meritocracy</h2>
      <p>Many companies say they hire based on ‚Äúmerit,‚Äù but that idea often hides real racial bias. Hiring managers may unconsciously judge candidates based on how they speak, dress, or where they went to school ‚Äî things that are shaped by race and class.</p>
      <p>The term <strong>‚Äúculture fit‚Äù</strong> is often used to exclude candidates who don‚Äôt match the company‚Äôs dominant (usually white and male) culture.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standardized hiring tests can favor candidates from certain educational backgrounds.</li>
        <li>Interviews often reward cultural familiarity over raw skill or creativity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bias in Tech Tools and Algorithms</h2>
      <p>Technology is often thought of as neutral, but it isn‚Äôt. Bias can be built into software, especially when it‚Äôs trained on data that reflects racial inequality.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Facial recognition systems:</strong> Misidentify Black and Brown faces more often.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiring software:</strong> Filters out names that ‚Äúsound Black.‚Äù</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive policing tools:</strong> Target communities of color.</li>
        <li><strong>Language models:</strong> May reflect harmful stereotypes based on training data.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="../images/racial bias.jpg" alt="racial bias" class="card-image" />
        </div>
      <h2>Digital Redlining</h2>
      <p>Digital redlining is when tech systems reinforce inequality by limiting access to online resources and opportunities. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some communities don‚Äôt have access to high-speed internet.</li>
        <li>Job ads are shown more to white users than Black ones.</li>
        <li>Tech education programs are less available in low-income or minority areas.</li>
        <li>Targeted advertising reinforces segregation in housing and finance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Erasure of Innovators</h2>
      <p>Many Black and Brown pioneers in tech have been left out of history books.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mark Dean:</strong> Helped invent the IBM PC.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarence ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù Ellis:</strong> First Black person to earn a PhD in computer science.</li>
        <li><strong>Katherine Johnson:</strong> Played a crucial role in NASA‚Äôs early space missions through complex calculations.</li>
      </ul>

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Retaliation Against Whistleblowers</h2>
      <p>When people of color speak out against racism in tech, they‚Äôre often ignored ‚Äî or worse, pushed out. One well-known case is Dr. Timnit Gebru, a leading AI researcher who was forced out of Google after raising concerns about racial bias in algorithms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethics researchers are often underfunded or dismissed in major tech companies.</li>
        <li>Racial justice advocates in tech may face public or professional backlash.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reclaiming Tech Through Activism</h2>
      <p>Despite the challenges, Black and Brown communities are reclaiming tech in powerful ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Black Girls Code:</strong> Teaches coding to young Black girls.</li>
        <li><strong>Data for Black Lives:</strong> Uses data science for justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Afrotech:</strong> Imagines inclusive futures where technology empowers all people.</li>
        <li><strong>Code2040:</strong> Creates pathways into tech for Black and Latinx students.</li>
      </ul>

  <p>
    The tech industry has long mirrored the inequalities of the world around it‚Äîbut that doesn't mean it has to stay that way. By learning about the past, confronting uncomfortable truths, and amplifying the voices of those historically pushed to the margins, we open the door to a more equitable future. Tech is powerful, but the people shaping it are even more so. Let‚Äôs keep building systems‚Äîand communities‚Äîthat reflect justice, access, and representation for everyone.
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
    The history of race in tech is one of barriers broken and voices rising. As the industry evolves, so does the fight for equity‚Äîand the next chapter is being written by all of us.
