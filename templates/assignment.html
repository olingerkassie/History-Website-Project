    <h1>Racial Ideologies in the Tech Industry</h1>
</header>

<div class="content">
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Racial thinking, the belief that a person's abilities, intelligence, or worth are determined by their race, has profoundly influenced the development and culture of the tech industry. From who gets hired to who builds the tools we use, racial ideologies have influenced access, opportunity, and representation. This section explores how these beliefs shaped the industry and continue to affect innovation, equity, and justice in tech today.</p>

        <h2>Exclusion From the Beginning</h2>
        <p>From the start, tech was seen as a space for white, affluent men. Black and Brown people were often excluded from science and tech education, especially in the early days of computing. Access to resources, training, and job opportunities was limited and still is in many places.</p>
        <p>According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s 2014 Diversity in High Tech Report, only 7.4% of employees in the high-tech sector were Black, even though Black individuals made up around 13% of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanic workers represented about 8% of the tech workforce, despite accounting for 18% of the population by 2019. When looking at gender and race together, the disparity grows Black, Latina, and Native American women collectively earned just 4% of computing degrees in 2016. A Wired article (paywalled) noted that in some companies, these representation gaps have seen little to no improvement over the following five years.</p>

        <h2>The Myth of Meritocracy</h2>
        <p>Many companies say they hire based on “merit,” but that idea often hides real racial bias. Hiring managers may unconsciously judge candidates based on how they speak, dress, or where they went to school — things that are shaped by race and class.</p>
        <p>The term <strong>“culture fit”</strong> is often used to exclude candidates who don’t match the company’s dominant (usually white and male) culture.Instead of focusing on skills and potential, companies sometimes use "culture fit" as an excuse to hire people who look, act, and think like the people already there. This keeps workplaces from becoming truly diverse and continues cycles of inequality, even when the company says it supports diversity.</p>

        <h2>Bias in Tech Tools and Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Technology is often thought of as neutral, but it isn’t. Bias can be built into software, especially when it’s trained on data that reflects racial inequality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Facial recognition systems: </strong> Misidentify Black and Brown faces more often.</li>
            <li><strong>Hiring software:</strong> Filters out names that “sound Black.”</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive policing tools:</strong> Target communities of color.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Erasure of Innovators</h2>
        <p>Many Black and Brown pioneers in tech have been left out of history books.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mark Dean:</strong> A computer scientist and engineer who helped develop the IBM personal computer (PC) in the 1980s. Dean holds three of the nine original patents for the IBM PC and later led the design team for the first 1-Gigahertz computer processor.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarence “Skip” Ellis:</strong> The first Black person to earn a Ph.D. in computer science (University of Illinois, 1969). He contributed to the development of operational transformation, a foundation for collaborative editing software like Google Docs, and worked on groundbreaking projects at Xerox PARC.</li>
            <li><strong>Evelyn Boyd Granville:</strong> One of the first African American women to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics. She worked on computer programming for NASA’s Apollo space missions.</li>

        <h2>Retaliation Against Whistleblowers</h2>
        <p>When people of color speak out against racism in tech, they’re often ignored, or worse pushed out. One well-known case is Dr. Timnit Gebru, a leading AI researcher who was forced out of Google after raising concerns about racial bias in algorithms  and questioning the ethical implications of large language models. Her departure sparked international outrage and brought attention to how tech companies handle dissent, particularly from marginalized employees.</p>

        <h2>Reclaiming Tech Through Activism</h2>
        <p>Despite the challenges, Black and Brown communities are reclaiming tech in powerful ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Black Girls Code:</strong> Founded by Kimberly Bryant, this organization empowers young Black girls by teaching them coding, robotics, and computer science skills, aiming to close the tech diversity gap from the ground up.</li>
            <li><strong>Data for Black Lives:</strong> A movement that harnesses the power of data science to fight systemic racism and promote justice. They advocate for ethical data practices that center and uplift marginalized communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Afrotech:</strong> One of the largest multicultural tech conferences, Afrotech brings together Black tech innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors to build a future where technology is inclusive, equitable, and empowering for all.</li>
        </ul>
